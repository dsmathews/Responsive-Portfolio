            <p>My life is amazing! I am a husband, father, teacher, coach, musician, and now a web
                developer in training. I come from a strong family background with high standards and a strong work
                ethic.</p>
            <p> My background before coming to web development was teaching high
                school and middle school band for fourteen years. During that time, I was responsible for personnel
                management, inventory control and acquisiton, finance and budget, as well as communications. These
                experiences helped me become the person I am today.</p>
            <br />
            <p> I enjoy helping others however I can. My mission in life to is try and spread as much good as possible.
                I am a member of various local and national organizations. In our community, my family and I attend a
                local Lutheran church.</p>
